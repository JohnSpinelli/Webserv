Webserver

-Our webserver is able to pass all test cases presented in the assignment. The following use cases indicate the procedure needed to run our code.

Use Cases

-To run our webserver within the terminal, type ./webserver xxxx, where xxxx represents a port number of your choice. The server can then be found on any browser by typing “localhost:xxxx/“ in the url, followed by the request you choose to make. 

-To run my-histogram, type “localhost:xxxx/my-histogram?directory=param1”, where param1 is the root directory from which you wish to count files. The output is directed into a .dat file which gnuplot uses to generate a histogram. The histogram is then embedded in an html file which we cat onto the browser.
